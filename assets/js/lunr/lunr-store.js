It can deconvolve multi color data very efficiently with a quality equal to Huygens Deconvolution. The routine is very generic and based on a loss function approach which is minimized with the automatic differentiation Zygote.jl and the...","categories": ["post","archive"],

Unlike many modern microscopes used for biological imaging, UC2 is not a black box and allows users to understand its operating principle. Additionally, UC2 is low-cost, 3D-printed, and modular, making it accessible to a...","categories": ["post","archive"],
